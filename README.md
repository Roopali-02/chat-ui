## Folder/component structure explanation
- `pages/`: Top-level route pages including Login, Dashboard, and ChatRoom.
- `store/`: Zustand store for managing auth state, chatrooms, and messages.

## How throttling, pagination, infinite scroll, and form validation are implemented
- Form Validation: Handled using React Hook Form + Zod on the login screen. Validates country code and phone number.
- Throttling: Search input in dashboard is throttled using lodash.debounce (300ms delay).
- Infinite Scroll: Older messages load when you scroll to the top in the chat screen (reverse infinite scroll). 
- Simulated AI Messaging: Gemini replies with delay using setTimeout, with typing indicator.
- OTP Simulation: OTP send/verify is faked using setTimeout and basic input checks.
- Image Upload: Messages support image preview using base64 via FileReader.
- Copy to Clipboard: Hover on a text message shows a copy button.
- Dark Mode: UI adapts based on dark/light mode toggle.
- Toast Notifications: Shown for actions like OTP sent, message copied.
